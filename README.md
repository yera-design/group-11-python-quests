This repository contains variety of scripts that are essential in building a foundation in Python programming.
They include 30 quests, ranging from simple print statements to building interactive text-based games. The quests are organized into levels based on programming concepts:
	1.	Level 1: Spells & Variables – Basic Python syntax, printing, and storing information.
	2.	Level 2: Dialogue with the Machine – User input and basic arithmetic.
	3.	Level 3: Crossroads of Logic – Conditional statements (if, elif, else).
	4.	Level 4: Power of Repetition – Loops (for, while).
	5.	Level 5: Alchemist’s Lab – Functions and reusable code.
	6.	Level 6: Grand Challenges – Combining skills into games and interactive programs.
