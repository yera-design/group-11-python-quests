This repository contains variety of scripts that are essential in building a foundation in Python programming.
They include 30 quests, ranging from simple print statements to building interactive text-based games. The quests are organized into levels based on programming concepts:
	1.	Level 1: Spells & Variables – Basic Python syntax, printing, and storing information.
	2.	Level 2: Dialogue with the Machine – User input and basic arithmetic.
	3.	Level 3: Crossroads of Logic – Conditional statements (if, elif, else).
	4.	Level 4: Power of Repetition – Loops (for, while).
	5.	Level 5: Alchemist’s Lab – Functions and reusable code.
	6.	Level 6: Grand Challenges – Combining skills into games and interactive programs.

Level 1: Spells & Variables
	1.	Your First Spell – Use print() to display a welcome message.
	2.	The Naming Ceremony – Create variables for a hero’s name and superpower.
	3.	The Treasure Chest – Understand data types: string vs integer.
	4.	The Town Crier – Combine variables and strings for dynamic messages.
	5.	The Echoing Cave – Reassign variables to reflect changing data.

Level 2: Dialogue with the Machine
	6.	The Fortune Teller – Ask the user for input using input().
	7.	The Magic Number Converter – Convert strings to numbers for math operations.
	8.	The Potion Brewer – Perform arithmetic calculations.
	9.	The Greedy Goblin – Use the modulo operator % for remainders.
	10.	The Architect’s Blueprint – Work with floating-point numbers to calculate areas.

Level 3: Crossroads of Logic
	11.	The Guardian of the Bridge – if statements for decisions.
	12.	The Two-Path Cave – if-else statements for alternative outcomes.
	13.	The Maze of Many Choices – if-elif-else for multiple conditions.
	14.	The Logical Gatekeeper – Logical operators (and, or, not) to combine conditions.
	15.	The Nested Riddle – Nested if statements for layered decision-making.

Level 4: Power of Repetition
	16.	The Marching Ants – Use a for loop to repeat tasks.
	17.	The Endless Staircase – Use a while loop with a condition.
	18.	The Loop of Riddles – Guessing game with a while loop.
	19.	The Countdown – Use range(start, stop, step) for a countdown.
	20.	The Even Number Forager – Use if inside a for loop to filter numbers.
